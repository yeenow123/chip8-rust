# Chip8 Rust 

This is an implementation of a Chip8 emulator in Rust.  The goal was to build my first emulator as well as learn Rust.

### Issues

- [ ] Collision detection is not working.  Try playing Pong, the collision detection only seems to work at the upper corner of the screen

### Running 

```
cargo run [FILENAME FOR GAME]
```

## Running the tests

```
cargo test
```
